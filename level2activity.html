        Welcome to our Electric Playground! 

        Let's talk about a few features of our playground before our activity.  

        The empty space in the middle is called the Workspace. This is where you will connect components and build your circuit. 

        Speaking of components, next up is the component library. 
        
        The component library is where you can find all the components we will need for the activity. When you need a component for an activity, you can use the mouse to drag and drop the component into the Workspace.  

        Finally, we have the home button which will take you back to the Main Menu of the game. 

        **ACTIVITY TIME** 

        It is time to build your first circuit!   

        We will start by dragging a battery into the Workspace.  

        Great!  

        Next drag a resistor into the Workspace.  

        Nice! 

        Next drag a light bulb into the Workspace.

        Super! 

        Woah check out the light bulb! Electrical energy is flowing from the battery, through the resistor and to the light bulb giving it power! 

        Great job building your first circuit!
